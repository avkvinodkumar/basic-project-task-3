**Gender & Age Prediction**

**Description**

In this project, we use machine learning and computer vision techniques with Python and OpenCV to analyze photos and predict the age and gender of individuals. The goal is to overcome common challenges such as cosmetics, lighting, and facial expressions that can affect the accuracy of the predictions.

**Project Overview**

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect a large dataset of photos of individuals with their corresponding age and gender labels.
2. **Face Detection**: Use OpenCV to detect faces in the images.
3. **Face Alignment**: Align the detected faces to a standard orientation using facial landmarks.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the aligned faces using a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques.
5. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using the extracted features to predict age and gender.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Features**

* Uses OpenCV for face detection and alignment
